<h1>Let's test code.</h1>
<p>Create an array and add three numbers to it.<br>
let array = [1, 2, 10];
</p>
<p>Use your array to return the second number.<br>
console.log(array[1]);
</p>
<p>What data type is 123/12? "Things in quotes!"? undefined?<br>
Number - JavaScript does not define different types of numbers, like integers, short, long, floating-point etc. 
</p>
<p>Write an if statement that returns true.<br>
if (5 > 1) {
    console.log("Yes 5 is greater than 1.")
}
</p>
<p>Consider these two arrays: myArray = ['Thomas', 'Sophie', 'Faraz'] and emptyArray = []. Use a for loop to add our names to emptyArray. (Hint: n needs to be the length of the array. Google a helper method for finding the length of an array in Javascript. Is it the same as Ruby?)<br>

    console.log(myArray.length); //The length property of an object which is an instance of type Array sets or returns the number of elements in that array. 
    // expected output: 4
